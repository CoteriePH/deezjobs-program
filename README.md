# About DeezJobs

A decentralized freelancing platform for safe and efficient client-freelancer collaboration.

### Problems we are solving
* Ghosting is a common scam in freelancing.
* KYC / lack of proper ID limits young individuals to work online.
* Freelancers are suffering from delayed payments and high fees.
* Reputation you have built-up in centralized platforms is not portable.

### Our solution
* Escrowed payments - The smart contract will hold the upfront payment until the job is completed.
* No KYC/ID verification needed - Millions of people without access to banking can start participating in gig economy.
* Crypto / SPL token payments - Send or receive funds in minutes from anywhere in the world with almost no fees (Thanks Solana). 
* Decentralized Identity - Userâ€™s reputation, job/gig listings, bad records, and other hard-earned data are on-chain and shareable across various freelancing dapps.
* Fair appeal/dispute resolution - There is no central entity to decide on the dispute resolution; it will be voted on by the community / NFT holders.
